# deligan
This project is an implementation of the Generative Adversarial Network proposed in our CVPR 2017 paper - DeLiGAN : Generative Adversarial Networks for Diverse and Limited Data. DeLiGAN is a simple but effective modification of the GAN framework and aims to improve performance on datasets which are diverse yet small in size.
